  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / High-Contrast Utility**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Radical Clarity**: Data is the hero. No fluff, just hard numbers and clear contrasts.
  2.  **Raw Functionality**: Exposed grids, visible borders, and a "dashboard-first" aesthetic that screams tool, not toy.
  3.  **Speed & Efficiency**: Visuals that imply instant processing and real-time data syncing.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Background**: Stark white (#FFFFFF) or very light grey (#F5F5F5) to act as a clean canvas.
  *   **Primary**: Deep, authoritative Blue (#0044CC) for trust and technology.
  *   **Accent**: Sharp, electric Green (#00CC66) specifically for "profit" and "growth" metrics, popping against the stark background.
  *   **Intent**: To convey that this is a serious, professional tool for making money. It feels like a financial terminal.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular / Bento Box**: Content is organized in distinct, bordered containers (cards) that fit together like a dashboard.
  *   **Asymmetric Grids**: Breaking the standard 12-column grid with varied container sizes to guide the eye dynamically.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Thick Borders**: 2px or 3px black or dark grey borders on cards and buttons.
  *   **Monospace Data**: Using a monospace font for all numbers and metrics to emphasize the "data" aspect.
  *   **Hard Shadows**: distinct, non-blurred drop shadows to give depth without softness.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons depress visibly; hover states are sharp and immediate (color invert).
  *   **Snap & Click**: Interactions feel mechanical and precise.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Instant Transitions**: minimal easing, fast cuts.
  *   **Data Ticking**: Numbers count up rapidly rather than fading in.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** or **Chakra Petch** – technical, slightly quirky, distinct.
  *   **Body**: **Inter** or **JetBrains Mono** – highly legible, functional.

  **Design Movement**: **Glassmorphism / Ethereal Tech**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Transparency & Depth**: Using layers of frosted glass to show depth and context, symbolizing "seeing through" the data.
  2.  **Fluidity**: Organic shapes and gradients that suggest the flow of data and money.
  3.  **Premium SaaS**: A polished, high-end look that justifies the value proposition.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Background**: Deep, rich dark mode (Dark Slate / Charcoal #0F172A) to reduce eye strain and make data pop.
  *   **Primary**: Luminous Blue (#3B82F6) glowing against the dark background.
  *   **Accent**: Neon Green (#10B981) for success metrics, glowing like LEDs.
  *   **Intent**: To make the user feel they are using a cutting-edge, futuristic piece of technology. "The future of affiliate tracking."
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Floating Elements**: Cards and sections float in 3D space, layered over subtle, moving background gradients.
  *   **Centralized Focus**: Key messages are centered with breathing room, surrounded by floating data points.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Frosted Glass Cards**: Background blur (backdrop-filter: blur) with thin, semi-transparent white borders.
  *   **Glow Effects**: Soft colored glows behind key elements and charts.
  *   **Mesh Gradients**: Subtle, slow-moving gradients in the background.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Smooth Flow**: Hover effects are gentle lifts and glows.
  *   **Parallax**: Elements move at different speeds when scrolling, creating immersion.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Float & Fade**: Elements drift into place.
  *   **Shimmer**: Loading states and highlights have a passing shimmer effect.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Plus Jakarta Sans** – geometric, modern, friendly but tech-forward.
  *   **Body**: **DM Sans** – clean, readable, with a touch of character.

  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Modernized)**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Objective Clarity**: The design should be invisible; the content (ROI) is the focus.
  2.  **Grid Systems**: Strict adherence to a mathematical grid for order and reliability.
  3.  **Asymmetry**: Using asymmetric layouts to create tension and interest without clutter.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Background**: Off-white / Cream (#FAFAF9) for a warm, paper-like feel, or a very soft cool grey.
  *   **Primary**: Swiss Red (#FF3333) or a strong Royal Blue (#0055FF) for bold emphasis.
  *   **Accent**: Forest Green (#228B22) strictly for positive financial data.
  *   **Intent**: To convey stability, reliability, and timelessness. "This is a professional standard."
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Split Screen**: Vertical division of space (text on left, visuals on right, or vice versa).
  *   **Typographic Scale**: Using massive font size differences to create hierarchy instead of decoration.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Big Typography**: Headlines are huge and tight.
  *   **Rule Lines**: Thin horizontal lines separating sections.
  *   **Photography/Abstracts**: High-quality, abstract geometric photography or shapes.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Minimalist**: Interactions are subtle—underlines, slight color shifts.
  *   **Direct**: No unnecessary motion; things appear where they should be.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Slide & Reveal**: Content slides in from behind masks.
  *   **Kinetic Type**: Text reveals itself in interesting ways.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Helvetica Now** or **Neue Haas Grotesk** (or **Inter** Tight) – the gold standard of neutrality.
  *   **Body**: **Roboto** or **Arial** – ubiquitous, invisible.
